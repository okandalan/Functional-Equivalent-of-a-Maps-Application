# Functional Equivalent of a Maps Application
This is solution for programming assignment of CENG213, Data Structure Course.

The task is implementing functional equivalent of a maps application (i.e. Google Maps, Yandex Maps etc.).
The assignment tests Graph, Hash Table, Quadratic Probing and Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm knowledge.

Graph
-----
Undirected graph class with non-negative weights is implemented by using adjaceny list representation. Finding shortest path or multiple shortest paths by using mask edges functions are few example of its functions

Hash Table
----
Another data structure that maps application is used is Hash Table. It is used for storing found paths and Quadratic Probing is used for prevent collisions.

METU Maps
----
METUMaps class is implemented by using Graph and KeyedHashTable classes.

More details about functions, classes and task can be found in the information.pdf
